    ### The original labels received from IMR have already been corrected for heave.
    ### This is not the case for the echogram (backscatter) data, not corrected for heave.
    ### Thus the original labels and echogram data do not match, being a ping-wise vertical displacement between them.
    ### To match labels and echogram data, we revert the heave-correction for the labels,
    ### obtaining labels and echogram data that are both NOT corrected for heave.

    ### Uncomment line below and run this script:
    ### Will generate and write numpy.memmap label files without heave compensation for all echograms. ###
    ### The 'force_write' option set to True will overwrite any existing files.

# This repository contain the code to make predictions from Olav's model

# It is slightly circular since you need to clone this repos to get the Dockerfile and
# then the dockerfile clones the repos inside the Dockerfile.

# For testing you can clone the testdata:
git clone https://github.com/nilsolav/LSSS-label-versioning
# The raw data have to be copied from pallas: /scratch/nilsolav

# Build the docker image
docker build --tag crimacwp4-unet:test .

# Set the display variable (replace with your IP)
set-variable -name DISPLAY -value 10.1.83.116:0.0

# Generate and run the container. The -v flag should point to the memmap files
# system, and the -p flag should be the port for the jupyter-notebook.
# Two directories needs to be linked:
# \datain\ should be mapped to the data directory where the memmap files
# \model\ should be mapped to the directory where the model weights are stored
# \dataout\ should be mapped to the directory where the memmap files are located
